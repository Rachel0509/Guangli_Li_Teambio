# Guangli_Li_TeamBio

## Description
This is my 1055-01-20S TeamBio Assignment.
This assignment is to use array syntax to save text information and switch back and forth with my team member information. It's very interesting. Only one player's information can be displayed at a time on the screen, but you can try clicking on another player to switch.


## Installation
Just clone the repo anywhere on your computer and create two new branch!
